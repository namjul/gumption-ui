<h1 align="center">Gumption</h1>

> I like the word ‘gumption’ because it’s so homely and so forlorn and so out of style it looks as if it needs a friend and isn’t likely to reject anyone who comes along. I like it also because it describes exactly what happens to someone who connects with Quality. He gets filled with gumption. A person filled with gumption doesn’t sit around dissipating and stewing about things. He’s at the front of the train of his own awareness, watching to see what’s up the track and meeting it when it comes. That’s gumption. If you’re going to repair a motorcycle, an adequate supply of gumption is the first and most important tool. If you haven’t got that you might as well gather up all the other tools and put them away, because they won’t do you any good.

The idea behind this project is to build react primitives my way. Combining all the ideas I resonate with and playing with them. I also love the idea of adding non-technical ideas like the word "gumption" to it.

The current status of this project is "not finished" so you probably won't find any useful code in here and maybe at best some drops of ideas. At the moment I don't know if I will proceed since priorities are shifting or maybe my lack of gumption makes it way in. I might return irregulary to it to continue this play .. or not. Gumption will tell.
